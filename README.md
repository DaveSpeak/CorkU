CorkNVine
A fun, friendly and unpretentious website where wine novices can find facts about types of wines, recommended pairings from BBQ to Sushi, vineyards, as well as  search for wine events by city or zipcode. No descriptions of floral bouquets with a hint of bs by oenophiles. (Oenophiles? Are you kidding me? Who can even pronounce that? The definition of “oenophile” is wine snob). Our site is designed to share information in an easy to read and understand format that makes the world of wine more accessible.
